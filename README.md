# SketchDistributor
Sketch plugin that distributes selected objects vertically or horizontally *with a specified spacing*.

The Sketch app allows you to distribute selected objects evenly, which is very handy. But sometimes you just want the objects distributed with a fixed spacing and that's when you turn to SketchDistributor. Like so:
