# SketchDistributor

Sketch plugin that distributes selected objects vertically or horizontally *with a specified spacing*.

Like so:

## Installation

I recommend using [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com), but you can also download and unpack the [zip archive](https://github.com/PEZ/SketchDistributor/archive/master.zip) and then open `Distributor.sketchplugin`, Sketch will open it up and install the plugin for you.

## How-to

You select the objects you want to distribute, then ask Distributor to do it:

1. **Distribute Horizontally …** (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>OPTION</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>), brings up the Distributor dialog box with *horizontal* distribution preselected. You specify spacing (in pixels).
1. **Distribute Vertically …** <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>OPTION</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>, same as above for *vertical* distribution.
1. **Distribute again** (kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>OPTION</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>) applies the last used distribution settings on the selected objects.
1. **Distribute …** (kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>OPTION</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>), same dialog box as above, but it will remember the last distribution direction. (Mostly here for legacy reasons.)

Note that you can use negative spacing to get overlap:
